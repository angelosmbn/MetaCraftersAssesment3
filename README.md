# ErrorHandling Smart Contract

## Overview

The `ErrorHandling` smart contract is a simple implementation of a token system on the Ethereum blockchain. It demonstrates the use of Solidity features such as `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` for error handling and balance management. This contract allows users to transfer tokens between addresses and provides functions to check invariants and withdraw tokens.

## Features

- **Token Transfers**: Users can transfer tokens to other addresses.
- **Balance Checks**: The contract ensures that users have sufficient balances before allowing transfers and withdrawals.
- **Error Handling**: Implements various error handling mechanisms:
  - **`require()`**: Validates conditions before executing code.
  - **`assert()`**: Checks for invariant conditions that should always be true.
  - **`revert()`**: Stops execution and reverts state changes when a condition is not met.
